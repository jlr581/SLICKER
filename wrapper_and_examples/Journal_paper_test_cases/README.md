The test cases in the subdirectories are all from the *PLOS ONE* journal paper, figures 7-9.  Specifically, the test cases are

# AR1
AR1 - Figure 4, AR1 pseudo-proxy test case

# missing_data
test 1 - Figure S2 a, no missing data, no noise

test 8 - Figure S2 b, 67% missing data for proxy 1, no noise

test 5 - Figure S2 c, 20% missing data for both proxies, no noise

test 7 - Figure S2 d, 40% missing data for both proxies, no noise

test 6 - Figure S2 e, 20% missing data for both proxies, theta=0.4 noise

# noise

test 2 - Figure S1 b, theta=0.1 noise

test 3 - Figure S1 c, theta=0.2 noise

test 4 - Figure S1 d, theta=0.4 noise

test 10 - Figure S1 e, theta=1.0 noise
