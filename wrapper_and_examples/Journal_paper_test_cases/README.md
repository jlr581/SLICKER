The test cases in the missing_data, noise and non_linear subdirectories are all from The Holocene journal paper, figures 7-9.  Specifically, the test cases are

# missing_data
test 1 - Figure 8a, no missing data, no noise
test 8 - Figure 8b, 67% missing data for proxy 1, no noise
test 5 - Figure 8c, 20% missing data for both proxies, no noise
test 7 - Figure 8d, 40% missing data for both proxies, no noise
test 6 - Figure 8e, 20% missing data for both proxies, theta=0.4 noise

# noise
test 1 - Figure 7a, no added noise 
test 2 - Figure 7b, theta=0.1 noise
test 3 - Figure 7c, theta=0.2 noise
test 4 - Figure 7d, theta=0.4 noise
test 10 - Figure 7e, theta=1.0 noise

# non_linear
test 14 - Figure 9a, linear reconstruction with unresolved proxy
test 9  - Figure 9b, linear reconstruction with high frequency nonlinear team
test 11 - Figure 9c, linear reconstruction with low frequency nonlinear team
test 14 - Figure 9d, non-linear reconstruction with unresolved proxy
test 9  - Figure 9e, non-linear reconstruction with high frequency nonlinear team
test 11 - Figure 9f, non-linear reconstruction with low frequency nonlinear team
